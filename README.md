# DEBTFREE

### Description

This code was developed based on the two state-of-the-art methods: Yu et al.'s semi-supervised Jitterbug [1] and  Ren et al.'s deep learning CNN [2] for SATDs Identification.

### Requirements

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### How To Run:

- To compare the best filtering candidate (RQ1):

```
python debtfree rq1
```

- To find the best candidate of Labeling/No-Labeling + Filtering/No-Filtering + Falcon/Hard  when the data is unlabelled (RQ2.1):

```
python debtfree unlabelled_data
```

- To find the best candidate of Filtering/No-Filtering + Falcon/Hard  when the data is labelled (RQ2.2):

```
python debtfree unlabelled_data
```
